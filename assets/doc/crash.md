# Debugging a crash

If the multiworld installer or app unexpectedly closes without showing an error message, follow these instructions to view the error message:

1. Contact @fenhl (`fenhl` on Discord) and let them know whether it is the installer or the multiworld app itself that is crashing. They will send you a debug build of that component. Download that file but don't open it.
2. Right-click your Windows button (the one that opens the Start menu) and select “Terminal” or “Windows PowerShell” depending on which one you have.
3. Open the folder with the downloaded file in it in File Explorer, right-click the file, and select “Copy as path”.
4. Go back to Terminal/PowerShell, type `&` and a space, then right-click on the Terminal/PowerShell window (which should paste the path).
5. Press <kbd>Return</kbd>. An error message should appear in the Terminal/PowerShell window. Send that error message to Fenhl.
