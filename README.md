This is **Mido's House Multiworld**, an alternative implementation of [multiworld](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Multiworld) for [the Ocarina of Time randomizer](https://ootrandomizer.com/) that improves upon [the existing implementation](https://github.com/TestRunnerSRL/bizhawk-co-op) by breaking compatibility with it. ([Feature comparison](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Multiworld#Feature_comparison))

# Installing

The easiest and recommended way to set everything up is by running the installer ([download for Windows](https://github.com/midoshouse/ootr-multiworld/releases/latest/download/multiworld-installer.exe) â€¢ [download for Linux](https://github.com/midoshouse/ootr-multiworld/releases/latest/download/multiworld-installer-linux)). It will guide you through setting up multiworld for BizHawk or Project64, and will also offer to install the emulator if you don't have it yet.

If you need help, please ask in [#setup-support on the OoTR Discord](https://discord.gg/BGRrKKn) (feel free to ping @Fenhl#4813) or [open an issue](https://github.com/midoshouse/ootr-multiworld/issues/new).

If you can't use the installer due to antivirus software blocking it, you can follow [the manual install instructions](https://github.com/midoshouse/ootr-multiworld/blob/main/assets/doc/manual-install.md).
